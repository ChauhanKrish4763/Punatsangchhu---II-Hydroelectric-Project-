      <h1>About Punatsangchhu-II Hydroelectric Project</h1>

      <p>
        The river of Phochhu & Mochhu originate from the glaciated terrain of the great Himalayan range,
        rising at an altitude of ±7,000 masl in Gasa Dzongkhag (District) of Bhutan, fed by snow/glacial lakes.
        The rivers Phochhu and Mochhu confluences at an altitude of ±1,200 masl at Punakha to form the Punatsangchhu 
        river which flows southerly to enter the Indian plains of West Bengal. The Punatsangchhu river eventually 
        draws into the Brahmaputra.
