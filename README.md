# Punatsangchhu-II Hydroelectric Project Website

This website presents an overview of the Punatsangchhu-II Hydroelectric Project (PHEP-II), a major 1,020 MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric initiative located in Bhutan. Developed jointly by the Governments of Bhutan and India, the project harnesses the energy from the confluence of the Phochhu and Mochhu rivers at Punakha to generate clean, sustainable electricity.

## ðŸŒŠ About the Project

The diversion dam for PHEP-II is situated approximately 20 kilometers downstream of the Wangduephodrang Bridge, with an underground powerhouse located at Kamechu. Designed to support Bhutan's growing energy needs and economic development, the project exemplifies regional cooperation and environmentally responsible engineering.

A Technical Coordination Committee comprising representatives from both governments oversees the project's technical execution and progress.
